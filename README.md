<h1> INSIGHTS </h1>

There are 200 records of patients. 52% of them are men and 48% are women. The patients are 15 to 74 years old.

We are going to make three age groups so to have a clear picture of the analysis. 
Group A= 15-34, Group B=35-54 and Group C=55-74.

People with high blood pressure take drug A, B and Y with Y to be the most common drug.

People with low blood pressure take drug Y, C and X with Y to be the most common drug.

People with normal blood pressure take drug Y and X with X to be the most common drug.

Drug A is given only to age groups 15-34 and 35-54 to patients with high bp.

Drug B is given only to age groups 35-54 and mainly to 55-74 to patients with high bp.

Drug C is given to all age groups to patients with low bp.

Drug X is given to all age groups to patients with normal and low bp.

Drug Y is the most common for all age groups and for all bp cases. A percentage of 41.76% that took drug Y was patients with high bp, follows 32.97% of low bp and then a 25.27% with normal pressure.

It looks like Y drug works like a pressure regulator as it is given in all cases.

High Sodium to potassium Ration in Blood can cause high or low bp. Patients with normal bp tend to have lower Na to K.

Those who have normal cholesterole levels are not allowed to take drug C. Normal level patients are mostly people in the category age 35-54. Surprisingly those who have normal cholesterole levels but high blood pressure are younger people (15-34).

Those who have high cholesterole levels are mostly older people and male in majority.

There is not trend in the relationship between high cholesterole levels and high blood pressure.
